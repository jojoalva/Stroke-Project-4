## Description
Healthcare data of individuals from Kaggle was used to train a machine learning algorithm. This algorithm's aim was to optimise the prediction on whether an individual was going to have a stroke or not, based on the variables in the dataset.

## Installation
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, postgresSQL, pgAdmin, Sci-kit learn, Imbalanced-learn

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was achieved by rounding the ages in decimals to the nearest full age. Gender 'Other' was dropped, which affected only one row. Also, the column smoking_status was dropped for the second round as it containted a large number of 'Unknown' values which means that the information is unavailable for this patient.

After saving both files as stroke_cleaned_v1.csv and stroke_cleaned_v2.csv, a few aggregate analysis were performed in SQL to give a brief overview on the dataset.
